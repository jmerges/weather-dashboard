## Description
This application searches for a city's weather data and displays it on the screen. It also forecasts the next
 5 days for the city. Each time a city is searched it is added to a list that is stored in localstorage. This list
 is displayed on the left hand side of the screen, and each city on the list is a clickable button that pulls up
 that city's weather data.

## Tools Used
I was given an image to go off of, but other than that I built the application from scratch using html, javascript, and bulma which
 is an online collection of CSS classes.
